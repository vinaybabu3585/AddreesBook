# Title:- Address book
## Name:- Vinay babu 
## Introduction:- <br>
This Address Book project is a simple yet functional console-based application written in C. It allows users to manage contacts by adding, updating, searching, and deleting names along with associated phone numbers and email addresses. The program leverages core C features such as file operations, input parsing, and command-line arguments â€” without relying on abstract data types like linked lists.<br>
This project reinforces key C programming concepts through a practical use case, offering a strong foundation for future enhancements such as integrating ADTs and implementing efficient search algorithms.
